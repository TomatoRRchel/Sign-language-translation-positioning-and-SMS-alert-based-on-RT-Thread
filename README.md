# Sign Language Translation System Based on Deep Learning
**The main function is in the application file directory**
This is a system based on the RT-Thread operating system using the STM32H750 as the main controller. It utilizes the RT-AK deep learning framework to encapsulate a trained sign language translation model into a library, which is embedded into the system to achieve sign language translation, with outputs visualized on a screen and also broadcast as speech. The system also features a function for the hearing-impaired to obtain the base station location in an emergency and send an alert message to emergency contacts. I am responsible for all kernel system development, including management of translation result objects, human-computer interaction, synchronization mechanisms, design of the RF module, and non-volatile storage.
